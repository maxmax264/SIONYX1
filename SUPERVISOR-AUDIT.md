## Issues Found and Fixed

### Critical

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 1 | **Permission denied on Organizations page.** `getSupervisorOrgs` read the entire `organizations/${orgId}` tree, but security rules only grant access to sub-paths (`users`, `packages`, `purchases`, `metadata`). | `supervisorOrgService.js` | Changed to read `metadata`, `users`, `purchases` sub-paths individually via `Promise.all`. |
| 2 | **Permission denied on supervisor login.** Firebase security rules for `supervisors/$uid` had never been deployed to Firebase. | `database.rules.json` | Deployed rules via `firebase deploy --only database`. |
| 3 | **`Space` not imported** in `SupervisorLayout.jsx`, causing `ReferenceError: Space is not defined` crash after login. | `SupervisorLayout.jsx` | Added `Space` to Ant Design imports. |

### UI / UX

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 4 | **Hardcoded dark-theme colors** (`#1a1030`, `#0f0a1f`, `rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`, etc.) across all supervisor pages. Text was nearly invisible with poor contrast. | All pages + layout | Removed all hardcoded colors. Now uses Ant Design's `theme.useToken()` and built-in dark mode algorithm for automatic, accessible contrast. |
| 5 | **Login page** had hardcoded dark gradient background and styled button. | `SupervisorLoginPage.jsx` | Uses `token.colorBgLayout` and default primary button styling. |
| 6 | **Layout sidebar** used hardcoded dark gradient, inline `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` style mutations for hover effects. | `SupervisorLayout.jsx` | Uses `token.colorBgContainer` and `token.colorBorderSecondary`. Logout button uses Ant Design's `danger` prop for hover. |
| 7 | **Dashboard cards** had custom semi-transparent backgrounds and colored icons. | `SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx` | Uses default `Card` and `Statistic` components which inherit theme automatically. |
| 8 | **Org detail page** title used hardcoded white text color. | `SupervisorOrgDetailPage.jsx` | Removed inline `color` style -- inherits from theme. |
| 9 | **Settings page** title had hardcoded white text. | `SupervisorSettingsPage.jsx` | Removed inline `color` style. |

### Responsiveness

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 10 | **Tables not scrollable** on small screens -- columns overflow horizontally. | `SupervisorOrgsPage.jsx`, `SupervisorOrgDetailPage.jsx` | Added `scroll={{ x: N }}` to all tables. Added `responsive: ['sm']` or `responsive: ['md']` to less-important columns (phone, remaining time, print balance, current user) so they hide on small screens. |
| 11 | **Orgs page had no title** -- just a raw table. | `SupervisorOrgsPage.jsx` | Added `Title` heading. |

### Code Quality

| # | Issue | File(s) | Fix |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 12 | **Console.log/console.error debug statements** left in production code from debugging session. | `supervisorAuthService.js` | Removed all debug logging. |
| 13 | **`useEffect` dependency warnings.** `[message]` from `App.useApp()` was used as dependency, causing potential re-renders. | `SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx`, `SupervisorOrgsPage.jsx` | Changed to `[]` with eslint-disable comment. `message` is stable from the Ant Design provider. |
| 14 | **Missing loading state on block modal submit.** User could click "Block" multiple times. | `SupervisorOrgDetailPage.jsx` | Added `submitting` state and `confirmLoading` prop on `Modal`. |
| 15 | **Test mocks missing `getIdToken`** after adding token refresh to login flow. | `supervisorAuthService.test.js` | Added `getIdToken: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue('token')` to all mock user objects. |

### Architecture Simplification (prior commit)

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|
| 16 | **Unnecessary Cloud Functions** for supervisor CRUD operations. `blockUser`, `unblockUser`, `getSupervisorOrgs`, `setSupervisorOrgSettings` added latency (cold starts) and cost (function invocations) for simple RBAC-based reads/writes. | Removed all 4 Cloud Functions. Rewrote client services to use direct Firebase `get`/`set`/`update`/`remove`. Updated security rules to grant supervisor direct write access to `blocked` fields, `blockedUsers` path, and `metadata/settings`. |
| 17 | **Multi-supervisor conflict resolution** in unblock logic was unnecessary complexity for a single-supervisor system. | Removed the multi-supervisor check. Unblock now directly clears the blocked flag. |

- `sionyx-web/src/supervisor/pages/SupervisorLoginPage.jsx` -- theme tokens
- `sionyx-web/src/supervisor/pages/SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx` -- theme tokens, useEffect deps

## Post-Audit Changes (Second Pass)

| # | Change | File(s) |
|---|--------|---------|
| 18 | **Removed Total Earnings statistic** from dashboard -- supervisors should not see financial data. | `SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx` |
| 19 | **Removed per-org revenue display** from dashboard org cards. | `SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx` |
| 20 | **Removed revenue column** from organizations table. | `SupervisorOrgsPage.jsx` |
| 21 | **Redesigned dashboard** with compact card-based layout: stat cards use colored top borders, 2x2 grid on mobile, org cards show icon + badge counts. Max-width 960px for readability. | `SupervisorDashboardPage.jsx` |
| 22 | **Added messaging system** for supervisors: new `/supervisor/messages` route, service, and page. Supervisors can send messages to users in any supervised org. Updated Firebase security rules to allow supervisor message writes. | `SupervisorMessagesPage.jsx`, `supervisorMessageService.js`, `database.rules.json`, `App.jsx`, `SupervisorLayout.jsx` |
| 23 | **Added title and scroll** to blocked users page for consistency and mobile support. | `SupervisorBlockedUsersPage.jsx` |
| 24 | **Improved settings page** with org count, creation date, and compact layout. Removed placeholder text. | `SupervisorSettingsPage.jsx` |

## Remaining Items (Not Bugs)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `SupervisorOperatingHoursSettings.jsx` uses custom `useIsMobile` via `window.matchMedia` instead of shared hook | Low priority | Functional, but inconsistent with layout's `useIsMobile` import. |
| `SupervisorOperatingHoursSettings.jsx` has hardcoded `DAY_COLORS` | Low priority | These are semantic colors for days-of-week, not theme-related. Acceptable. |
| Firebase rules tests require emulator | By design | `tests/rules/supervisor-rules.test.js` needs `firebase emulators:start --only database`. Run via `make test-rules`. |
